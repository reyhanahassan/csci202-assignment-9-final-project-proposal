    <h1>Project Proposal: Music Over the Last 10 years </h1>
    <p>For this project, I chose to analyze the Billboard Hot 100 and present trends in certain features
        and top artists over the past 10 years. I've already 11 different data sets curated for a side project
        I recently started , each containing songs from the Billboard Hot 100 for that year, along with  
        the artist, album, track ID, duration, speechiness, instrumentalness, acousticness, 
        liveness, loudness, energy, danceability, tempo, and valence. I was able to collect data 
        on the features using the Spotify Web API.
        The Spotify Web API is an interface that takes the Spotify ID of any song, album, 
        or playlist and retrieves data on the content such as song names, artists, album, 
        and audio features as well as speechiness, acousticness, duration, etc.
        For now, I plan to display a selection buttons for each year. The user would have the option to
        choose a year, displaying the top artist and genre along with rest of the top 100 songs. This page 
        could also show it's ranking in each feature compared to other years. For example, the page for 2016
        could show say "#5 in Liveness" (not necessarily true). 
        The dataset also contains some machine learning, such as predicitions of how music in the near future will sound, 
        along.
        I was considering on adding my findings from that onto the site, however, I'm not exactly sure if it works correctly 
        so I don't think it's worth presenting it just yet.
